# Down Days
Created: 2022-03-15 22:56
i desperately need to figure out a way of getting around down days.

at the moment i lie in bed a do fuck all - i know this is alright sometimes however not something i want to be deling with when i have deadlines and it is something i want to avoid in general.

i feel like this is of depression in nature and there have to be ways of minimising the effect of these days
